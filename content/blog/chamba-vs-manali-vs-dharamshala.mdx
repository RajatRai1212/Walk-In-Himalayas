Each region offers a different flavor of trekking. Here is a quick comparison.

## Chamba Valley

Great for offbeat village walks, heritage trails, and high passes like Sach Pass.

## Dharamshala

Best for iconic ridges like [Triund](/treks/triund-trek) and high passes like [Indrahar Pass](/treks/indrahar-pass-trek).

## Manali & Kullu

Perfect for alpine passes and lakes such as [Hampta Pass](/treks/hampta-pass-trek) and [Bhrigu Lake](/treks/bhrigu-lake-trek).

If you want quieter trails and cultural immersion, start with [Chamba Valley](/destinations/chamba-valley).
